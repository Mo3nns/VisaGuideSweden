          <p class="size">Applying for a Schengen visa can be a daunting task, especially when trying to navigate
            through the process and gather all the necessary information. My wife and I experienced this firsthand when

            out the application and were constantly worried about making mistakes or forgetting important documents.

              href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/download/18.5e83388f141c129ba6312919/1632218110438/blvisa_119031_en.pdf"
              target="_blank">Schengen application form</a>, if you need help completing the
            application please
            click on the link below. <br>
            <a href="../Files/Schengen_blueprint_invite.pdf" target="_blank">Schengen application Template</a> <br>
            On all the application links, we have made an example document where you can find inspiration on how to
            fill out the forms so it's easier for you.
          </p>
          <h3 class="pt-3">Proof of income</h3>

          <p class="size">To prove your income, you need to provide a bank statement showing that you have a minimum of
            450 SEK per day of your stay in the Schengen area. For example, if you plan to stay in Sweden for 14 days,
            you would need to have at least 6300 SEK (450 SEK x 14 days) in your account. However, it's important to
            note that you'll also need money for other expenses such as plane tickets and the visa fee. It's always
            recommended to have more in your account than the minimum requirement.
          </p>

          <h3>Passport document</h3>

          <p class="size">For this step, you will need a valid passport that is less than 10 years old and has at least
            three months of validity remaining beyond the date you plan to leave the Schengen area. You will need to
            scan all the pages of your passport, including any previous Schengen stamps. If you can't find your old
            passport, don't worry, you can explain that to the consulate when you submit your application. They will
            only ask for it if necessary.
          </p>

          <h3> Flight tickets & hotel reservation</h3>

          <p class="size">Depending on your country of origin, you may be required to have booked flight tickets before
            submitting your visa application. To ensure that you get your money back if your visa application is denied,
            I suggest booking tickets with a well-known airline that offers free cancellation. Premium tickets are
            usually more expensive, but they offer more flexibility in case your visa doesn't get approved. However, not
            everyone can afford premium tickets, so you can also book through an agency that specializes in reservations
            for visa applications. You can also book a premium ticket and then cancel the ticket when the visa has been
            approved, then book a new ticket that is cheaper.
          </p>

          <p class="size"> When it comes to hotel reservations, it's best to book through a company that offers free
            cancellation. This
            way, you won't lose money if your visa is denied. I recommend using companies such as Booking.com or
            Hotels.com, but make sure to check if they offer free cancellation before booking.
          </p>

          <h3>Insurance</h3>

          <p class="size">It's important to have valid travel insurance when applying for a permit to Sweden. Keep in
            mind that the cheapest option may not always be the best. We recommend using <a
              href="https://www.erv.se/privat/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIh_bthImO9QIVRI9oCR02mA5wEAAYASAAEgKqs_D_BwE"
              target="_blank"> ERV insurance</a>, which offers a
            good price and a full refund if your visa application is denied. Another reputable option is <a
              href="https://www.axa-schengen.com/en?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIkfCpn4iO9QIViwCLCh3jsgMwEAAYASAAEgKaDvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds"
              target="_blank"> AXA-Schengen</a>.
            insurance,
            But if you choose any other insurance company, please make sure that they cover costs of at least 30,000
            Euros.

          </p>
          <p class="size">You will need to show proof that you have a valid insurance when you hand in the
            application. </p>

          <h3>Travel plans</h3>

          <p class="size">When filling out your visa application, you will be asked to provide information about your
            travel plans. It's a good idea to write your plans on a separate piece of paper before completing the
            application. Include information about where you will be staying, such as hotels or a friend's place. If you
            plan to stay with a friend, it's important to provide additional information and proof that they own or rent
            the property. This can be done by obtaining a copy of a rental contract or a house deed. If you will be
            staying with a friend for the entire trip, you may want to consider applying for a Schengen invitation visa.
          </p>
          <h3 class="pt-3">Interview</h3>
          <p class="size">Once you have submitted your visa application, you will be required to attend an interview at
            the embassy. The embassy will verify the information that you have provided in the application. They will
            try to determine that you are who you say you are, that you have enough money to support yourself during
            your trip, that the reasons for traveling are valid and related to the permitted activities for this type of
            visa, that you are of good character and have no criminal intent, and that you are not planning to stay
            longer than your visa allows or work in the Schengen Zone. During the interview, you may be asked further
            questions regarding why you want to go to Sweden. Just stay calm and answer all the questions truthfully. It
            is also recommended that you prepare by memorizing some of the locations you will be traveling to and how
            you are connected to the person inviting you. If you have been honest when filling in the application, there
            is nothing to worry about; just remember the details of the application</p>
          <h3 class="pt-3">Processing time</h3>
          <p class="size">For a Schengen visa the processing time is usually 15 days, it can also go quicker and also
            longer. The processing time can vary from country to country. <br>
            At <a href="https://visa.vfsglobal.com/aus/en/aut/guide-to-processing-times" target="_blank">VFSglobal.com
            </a> you can find more information regarding the processing time for your country.

            If the person inviting you is acting as a sponsor, they will also need to provide proof of income or assets.
            This could include a permanent job contract, proof of property ownership, work contract, pay slips, and a
            bank statement for the last 90 days.

          </p>
          <h3 class="pt-3">Passport</h3>

          <h3 class="pt-3">Travel plans & Reason for visit </h3>
          <p class="size">When filling out your Schengen or invitation visa application, you will be asked to explain
            why you want to visit Sweden. Be sure to provide detailed information about the purpose of your trip. If the
            space in the application is not enough, you can write your explanation on a separate document and include it
            with your application. Make sure to sign the document and bring it with you when you submit your
            application.</p>
          <p class="size">The reason for your visit is important and will be closely evaluated by the embassy. Be sure
            to provide as much detail as possible about why you want to see each other and your relationship status.
            It's important to clearly demonstrate that the person being invited has a reason to leave Sweden after the
            visa is finished. Many visa applications are denied because the embassy is not convinced that the visitor
            will leave at the end of the visa period.</p>
          <p class="size">If the person applying for the visa have a house or a job or something of value that makes the
            person obligated to leave Sweden after the visit, then add that to the application by making a copy of the
            documents. We and many others have been denied because we don't show enough proof that the person visiting
            will go home after the visit. If you haven't met in person or you haven't seen each other in a while, print
            out chat history and send it in with the application.
            Also if you have pictures taken togheter it's a good idea to send them in with the application as well.</p>
          <h3 class="pt-3">Interview</h3>
          <p class="size">Once you have submitted your visa application, you will be required to attend an interview at
            the embassy. The embassy will verify the information that you have provided in the application. They will
            try to determine that you are who you say you are, that you have enough money to support yourself during
            your trip, that the reasons for traveling are valid and related to the permitted activities for this type of
            visa, that you are of good character and have no criminal intent, and that you are not planning to stay
            longer than your visa allows or work in the Schengen Zone. During the interview, you may be asked further
            questions regarding why you want to go to Sweden. Just stay calm and answer all the questions truthfully. It
            is also recommended that you prepare by memorizing some of the locations you will be traveling to and how
            you are connected to the person inviting you. If you have been honest when filling in the application, there
            is nothing to worry about; just remember the details of the application</p>

          <h3 class="pt-3">Processing time</h3>
          <p class="size">For a Schengen visa the processing time is usually 15 days, it can also go quicker and also
            longer. The processing time can vary from country to country. <br>

            </a> you can find more information regarding the processing time for your country.</p>
