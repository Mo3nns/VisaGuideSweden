          <p class="size">Applying for a 6-month permit to Sweden can be confusing, but we're here to help. We'll guide
            you through the process step by step and provide all the necessary documents for the application. All the
            files you need will be linked in our guide, and we've also created a page with all the files in one place
            for easy access. Don't worry about spending money on a consultant or struggling to find the information you
            need, our ultimate visa guide is free and will answer any questions you may have.</p>


          <p class="size">This application you can either send in online through the E-application on the Swedish
            immigration website or you could book a time at the nearest Swedish embassy. However you will need to go to
            the embassy and let them scan your fingerprints, it's for the UT-card that you will recive if you are
            granted a permit. If you do the application online you will get the information during the process.

                inspiration on how to exactly fill out the forms so it's easier for you.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="pt-3">Proof of income</h3>
          <p class="size">
            To prove your income, you need to provide a bank statement showing that you have a minimum of 450 SEK per
            day of your stay in Sweden. For example, if you plan to stay in Sweden for example 14 days, you will need to
            have at least 6300 SEK (450 SEK x 14 days) in your account. However, it's important to note that you'll also
            need money for other expenses such as plane tickets and the visa fee. It's always recommended to have more
            in your account than the minimum requirement.<br> You can obtain the required bank statement from your bank
            by
            either printing it out if you have online banking or visiting a bank branch and requesting a statement for
            the last three months.
          </p>
          <h3 class="pt-3">Passport</h3>
          <p class="size">
            For this step, you will need a valid passport that is less than 10 years old and has at least three months
            of validity remaining beyond the date you plan to leave the Schengen area. You will need to scan all the
            pages of your passport, including any previous stamps from older visits in Sweden if any.
          </p>
          <h3 class="pt-3">Flight and Hotel</h3>
          <p class="size">You don't need to have a flight reservation for this type of permit, but you will on the other
            hand need to show where you will stay during your visit in Sweden. You will need to book a hotel or any
            other type of living arrangement, you will also need documents proving that you have a place to stay when
            you arrive to Sweden. </p>
          <p class="size">If you plan to stay at a hotel, then book with a company like booking.com or Hotells.com so
            you easily can see if the reservations can be cancelled in case you permit gets denied. </p>
          <p class="size">If you have a person inviting you then you will write their address, but only if you intend to
            stay at their location. Otherwise, you will have to book a hotel or any other kind of living arrangements to
            prove that you have a place to stay in Sweden.
          </p>
          <h3 class="pt-3">Insurance</h3>
          <p class="size">It's important to have valid travel insurance when applying for a permit to Sweden. Keep in
            mind that the cheapest option may not always be the best. We recommend using <a
              href="https://www.erv.se/privat/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIh_bthImO9QIVRI9oCR02mA5wEAAYASAAEgKqs_D_BwE"
              target="_blank"> ERV insurance</a>, which offers a
            good price and a full refund if your visa application is denied. Another reputable option is <a
              href="https://www.axa-schengen.com/en?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIkfCpn4iO9QIViwCLCh3jsgMwEAAYASAAEgKaDvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds"
              target="_blank"> AXA-Schengen</a>.
            insurance,
            But if you choose any other insurance company, please make sure that they cover costs of at least 30,000
            Euros.

          </p>
          <p class="size">You will need to show proof that you have a valid insurance when you hand in the
            application. </p>

          <h3 class="pt-3">Travel plans & Reason for visit </h3>
          <p class="size">When filling out your permit or invitation application, you will be asked to explain
            why you want to visit Sweden. Be sure to provide detailed information about the purpose of your trip. If the
            space in the application is not enough, you can write your explanation on a separate document and include it
            with your application. Make sure to sign the document and bring it with you when you submit your
            application.</p>

          <h4 class="pt-2">For application where you have a sponsor or partner</h4>
          <p class="size">The reason for your visit is important and will be closely evaluated by the embassy. Be sure
            to provide as much detail as possible about why you want to see each other and your relationship status.
            It's important to clearly demonstrate that the person being invited has a reason to leave Sweden after the
            visa is finished. Many visa applications are denied because the embassy is not convinced that the visitor
            will leave at the end of the visa period.</p>
          <p class="size">If the person applying for the permit have a house or a job or something of value that makes
            the
            person obligated to leave Sweden after the visit, then add that to the application by making a copy of the
            documents. We and many others have been denied because we don't show enough proof that the person visiting
            will go home after the visit. If you haven't met in person or you haven't seen each other in a while, print
            out chat history and send it in with the application.
            Also if you have pictures taken togheter it's a good idea to send them in with the application as well.</p>
          <h3 class="pt-3">Processing time</h3>
          <p class="size">
            According to the Swedish immigration's website, 75% that apply will get a decision within 4 months. So that
            means it can take longer time as well if you are unlucky. One thing that can help you to get a decision
            within these 4 months is to make a solid application. If the immigration has questions, the processing time
            could take longer. If you want to see the latest information regarding the processing time, please visit
